Bootstrappers, microISVs, micropeneurs, small software businesses — whatever you want to call them, they are way more interesting (to me, anyway) than the over-hyped Silicon Valley bullshit that so many are infatuated with.

Unfortunately, sometimes it is hard to find information about going this route, so I figured I would cull the links I have floating around and share the love. They inspire me to continue to pursue my passions even if I am not making any money (yet).

## Podcasts

I used to listen to a lot of other podcasts in this space, but these are the two that I’ve continued with and I enjoy the most.
